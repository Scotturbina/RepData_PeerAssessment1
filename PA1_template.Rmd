## Loading and preprocessing the data
#### Download and unzip file, then upload the file into R 
```
library(readr)
activity <- read_csv("~/DataScience/Rep Research/activity.csv")
View(activity)
```
#### Preprocessing data
```
activity$day <- weekdays(as.Date(activity$date))
activity$DateTime<- as.POSIXct(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
```
####Pulling data without nas
```
clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#### Sum Steps by day and makes and histogram
```
stepsbyday <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
hist(stepsbyday$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Per Day"), col="red", xlab="Count of Steps")
```
#### Calculating mean and median of steps per day
```
rmean <- mean(stepsbyday$steps)
rmedian <- median(stepsbyday$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
#### Take the invertal mean steps
```
stepsinterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
```
#### Plot the mean interval
```
plot(stepsinterval$interval,stepsinterval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day Interval", col="blue")
```
#### Take the maximun interval
```
max_interval <- stepsinterval[which.max(stepsinterval$steps),1]
max_interval
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
